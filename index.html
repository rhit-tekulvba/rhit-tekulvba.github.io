			Hi! My name is Bryce Tekulve. I am a sophomore Computer Science and Software Engineering Major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I want to develop software that will make people's lives better. This can be practical or as simple as making people smile or laugh. I view software as an art which I hope everyone in the world can enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
			My largest passion is helping other people. I am a Sophomore Advisor at Rose-Hulman, meaning I live with freshmen and help foster a fun and memorable expereince for them. I am also a member of APO, a national serive fraternity. I try to give back to my community whenever I am able to and love creating more positivity in the world.
